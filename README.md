# Learning-refelction-and-tips

Reflect on my learning as well as provide some tips for people who are also new to physical computing


### Initial thoughts about physical comupting

Before Monday's class, I thought phisical computing is something doing with assembling computer hardware or experiments with circuit like I have done in high scool Physics class. However, after introduction done by Jasmine, I realized that physical computing is a more broader term: it stands for interacting ith real-world objects by programming form a computer. Things like automatic door is also a kind of physical computing.This really opened up my view in the creative computing world.




### Learning process on Arduino

As I have mentioned before. I have done few circuits in high school Physics lessons but I have already forget them all. So this is basically a start-from-scratch situation for me. Even though I am really weak at it but I still managed to finish a few with my own efforts and helps from peers. I found it really difficult when making the first circuit since I am not familiar with all the elements in Arduino and I can't really see which part to plug into the wire from the Youtube video. However, I tried many times taking closer look at the video and asked help form my peers who have finished the first circuit and I finally light up the LED! ü•≥ü•≥

The first circuit successed! üôå




### Reflection

From this week's learning, I got a deeper understaning of what is creative computing. It is a really fatastic field and it is all around us helping us living a better life but not what I thought as boring coding before. Although circuit isn't really my thing but I can try harder to take a deeper exploration into it since I think if I try harder I still can manage to do more circuits and facing the things I am not good at and then try to overcome it is what makes me improve. But at least I still pround of what I have finished with. Moreover,from the physical computing lesson I realize sometimes asking for others help at what they are good at is a good thing to do, it is not rely on others for success, it is some kind of helping each others out community and it is really good experiemnce! 

Furthermore, when I want to design somthing relayed to crreative computing I will not get loss since Jasmine has given many resources in the presentation which can helping me solve problems i faced when exploring the creative computing world. Also, some drawbacks of this industry mentions by Jasmine also makes me think. For example, why there is every barnd launching a new phone every year? Does it necessart to do it or it is just more about making money? Since either ways it is crearting loads of waste like extra carbon emission which is obviously not good for the deteriorating environment. I think I can do something to at least helping people realize this kind of drawbacks of developing technologies using my designs in the future.




### TIPS üëè

If you are also new to the physical computing or the creative industry, from my own learning experience in this week, I can think of few tips for you to make things easier.
- If you don't know or don't sure about something, don't hesitate to ask people around you!
    - Since, from my perspective, things related to this field sometimes is hard to understand from videos or etc on the Internat, especially for hand-on things like making the circuit. Asking help from the real world is much easier since you can physically interact.
    - However, if you can't find someone in real life who can help with your problems, websites like Stack Overflow can be really useful!
- It is not easy to code, but don't be afraid of tring!
    - Coding is never a easy things but people who are not at computing like me can do some very easy codeing like making the text **blod** using Markdown. So don't be afraid! It is something eveyone can do a little bit! üòÉ üëç
